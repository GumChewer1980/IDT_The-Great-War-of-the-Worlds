        Special version of the Carcano rifle, designed
        for the Cavalry. Designed in 1890 by the team led by Army Engineer
        Salvatore Carcano. Calibrated on the rimless 6.5x52 mm cartridge, it
        does not have much stopping power or a particularly long range, but it
        is a stable rifle and can shoot faster than most bolt-action weapons. It
        is recommended for use at medium range, although it is also ideal for
        close combat. It has an integrated folding bayonet that unfolds when

        The first SMG to enter service with the Italian
        Royal Army and probably the first to be used en masse by a military
        force, the Moschetto Automatico Beretta Modello 1914 has an impressive
        firing rate of 900 RPM, capable of emptying its 25-rounds 9mm Glisenti
        magazine in the blink of an eye. Its biggest problem is its biggest
        advantage, since the high rate makes it a very imprecise weapon. In
        addition, it loses stopping power quickly, so its use is recommended for
        point-blank shooting at short distances. Includes a folding bayonet.

        modifying the trigger mechanism to operate both at the same time. This
        was the original purpose of the weapon, in fact. A pistol grip and a
        front grip were added to maximize the weapons handling. It has a
        shooting rate almost doubled by the two barrels of the MAB14s, but a
        considerably lower accuracy which is compensated to some extent by the
        large amount of carried ammunition

        While its use is still debatable (due to its hypothetical use on humans
        and its toxicity on the body), there is no doubt that it is effective
        against the enemy. The gas directly attacks the affected individual's

      STR_M1907_SL_CARBINE_MAG: M1907 SL Carbine Mag
      STR_M1907_SL_CARBINE_MAG_KMM: M1907 SL Carbine K-MM Mag
      STR_ANNIHILATOR_SMG: Annihilator SMG
      STR_ANNIHILATOR_SMG_UFOPEDIA: Conceived by US Army General John Thompson as a powerful compact machine gun, its primary function is to deliver a hailstorm of lead in tight trenches, obliterating everything in its path. Well, it lives up its name after all.
      STR_ANNIHILATOR_SMG_MAG: Annihilator Mag
      STR_ANNIHILATOR_SMG_MAG_KMM: Annihilator K-MM Mag
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PROTOTYPE: "Phlogiston Prototype"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PROTOTYPE_UFOPEDIA: "The Wizniewsky-Nospmoht Phlogiston Energy Beam Projector Mk.1 is the first practical energy weapon created by the Beam Committee, able to be small enough to be used by a regular soldier, yet powerful enough to melt several inches of steel. The highest quality ruby rods and refraction lenses were used in this prototype, which in turn, makes it highly expensive to mass produce. The excess heat is vented manually using a bolt-action mechanism, which also allows the weapon to load another rod in the Chamber."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HEAVY_RIFLE: Phlogiston Heavy Rifle
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HEAVY_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: A heavy frame houses the largest handheld application of Phlogiston technology. The Ruby Rod Emitter is so powerful that needs a new ruby crystal with each use. The excess heat is vented after replacing the rod, in a mechanism similar to a bolt-action rifle. The bipod is meant to increase the handling, as the beam weapons have no recoil.
      STR_PHLOGISTON_RUBY_CLIP: Phlogiston Ruby Rod Clip
      STR_PHLOGISTON_BATTLE_RIFLE: Phlogiston Battle Rifle
      STR_PHLOGISTON_BATTLE_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The weapon designed to change the battlefield. A sturdy structure with a specially adapted Ruby Rod Emitter to ease heat dissipation, the Battle Rifle is expected to be the next main weapon of the infantryman. The only drawback is the lack of a bayonet lug (as the refraction lenses could break if hit too much).
      STR_PHLOGISTON_MEDIUM_BATTERY: Phlogiston Medium Battery
      STR_PHLOGISTON_AUTOMATIC_CARBINE: Phlogiston Automatic Carbine
      STR_PHLOGISTON_AUTOMATIC_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: One of the most successful applications of Phlogiston tech, the ruby rod chamber was mounted over the frame of a Winchester M1907 SL carbine, with the barrel adapted to fit the magnification lenses. A forward grip was added to increase the stability when aiming down the sights. The result is a relatively light weapon with superior handling.
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PISTOL: Phlogiston Pistol
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: Built as a light and effective sidearm based around the ruby rod beam tech. After several tries, it was found the energy mechanisms fitted inside a large handgun like the Colt M1911. Subsequent models used the blueprints of the handgun as basis. The barrel slits gets illuminated once the battery charges the beam emitter.

      STR_TRANQUILIZER_SHOTGUN_DARTS: "Tranquilizer Dart-Shells"
      STR_TRANQUILIZER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A special purpose single-shot, break-action shotgun, designed to shoot blank shells with highly experimental darts filled with a clasified chemical compound inside, meant to incapacitate Martians. The darts have a syringe-like point that penetrates the thick skin of the Grays. The main drawback is the limited range of the dart once fired and the fact the enemy may take several shots to sedate, as we are unaware of the exact measure of chemicals required to fully knock them down."
      STR_SONIC_HANDGUN: "Sonic Compact Handgun"
      STR_SONIC_HANDGUN_UFOPEDIA: "Experience learnt with the Tranquilizer long guns showed the specialists tasked on stunning Grays were often in need of a lighter sidegun, as the bulky shotguns weren't easy to use. We've designed a small emitter, compact enough to fit inside a modified C93 pistol frame."
      STR_SONIC_RIFLE: "Sonic Ranged Disrupter"
      STR_SONIC_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A direct replacement of the cumbersome Tranquilizer shotguns. This weapon is lighter than it seems and emitters a high-pitched sound in the same frequency heard by the average Martian. The amplifying antenna is highly fragile, so using it for melee combat is not recommended."

        causing 6 points of damage when consuming the bread in bad condition.
      STR_CANNED_BEEF: Corned Beef
      STR_CANNED_BEEF_UFOPEDIA:
        Corned beef is a salt-cured beef product. The term
        comes from the treatment of the meat with large-grained rock salt, also
        called "corns" of salt. Despite its taste, it is a popular alternative
        to fresh meat, so scarce in wartime. Its canning prevents the contents
        from spoiling. When consumed, the soldier recovers 30 units of energy
        and 25 of morale.
      STR_ROTTEN_CANNED_BEEF: Rotten Corned Beef
      STR_ROTTEN_CANNED_BEEF_UFOPEDIA:
        This is a Corned Beef can that has suffered
        damage due to the passage of time. The previous user of this can has
        opened it a little and its contents have been spoiled, but it is still a
        little edible. By feeding on this, a soldier recovers 30 moral points,
        25 energy points, but loses 15 health units, due to stomach discomfort
        caused by this decomposing food.
      STR_BISCUIT_BOX: Biscuit Box

        recovers a hungry soldier 15 points of energy and 25 of morale.
      STR_ROTTEN_BISCUIT_BOX: Rotten Biscuit Box
      STR_ROTTEN_BISCUIT_BOX_UFOPEDIA:
        The little biscuits in this box have long been
        decomposed.  They have become leathery and very hard, but in times of
        need, they can still be consumed.  By feeding on these muffins, a
        soldier recovers 15 units of energy, 25 units of morale, but suffers 6
        units of damage due to eating rotting food.
      STR_WINE: Wine Bottle
      STR_WINE_UFOPEDIA:
        A truly excellent vintage, this wine, although not of the
        best quality, is delicious. A necessary relief for the nightmares of the
        battle front, when drinking a sip of this delicacy, the soldier recovers
        30 units of energy, 100 of morale, but receives 15 units of damage by
        stunning, due to the state of drunkenness that is generated when
        ingesting alcoholic beverages.
      STR_BROKEN_WINE_BOTTLE: Broken Wine Bottle
      STR_BROKEN_WINE_BOTTLE_UFOPEDIA: It is hard to imagine how frustrating and
        demoralizing it is for a soldier to find a broken bottle of a good wine.
        Finding a quality aged wine is difficult in these dark days and this
        bottle is no exception. The only thing left for the soldier who wields
        this improvised weapon is to use all his anger against the invader,
        causing impressive damage. Martians have so little respect for the fine
        things in life...
      STR_BROKEN_WINE_BOTTLE_RAGE: RAGE!
      STR_TEA_FLASK: Tea Flask
      STR_TEA_FLASK_UFOPEDIA:

      STR_WHISTLE_UFOPEDIA:
        Small device designed to emit a loud, high-pitched sound.
        It is used by officers to indicate an attack or an infantry charge. If
        used directly on a soldier, increase the TUs by 20, courage by 10 and
        reactions by 5, as a result of the morale rise. However, it can tire the
        soldier who uses the whistle, because he loses his breath when using it
        with all his strength.
      STR_STIMPACK: Ah! That's the stuff!

      STR_TESLA_PROTOTYPE: "Tesla 'Thunder' Prototype"
      STR_TESLA_PROTOTYPE_UFOPEDIA: "The very first successful application of
        electrical weaponry made by Nikola Tesla. It's hard to classify this
        piece of machinery, as it could fit a variety of roles. The Low Powered
        shot consumes less Battery than other Electric weapons and the High
        Powered shot greatly amplifies the damage output. The range and accuracy
        are decent."
      STR_TESLA_TRENCH_BROOM: "Tesla 'Hurricane' Trench Broom"
      STR_TESLA_TRENCH_BROOM_UFOPEDIA: "A devastating Electric weapon meant to

      STR_FRENCH_SOLDIER_INTRODUCTION: Le Poilu
      STR_FRENCH_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: There is no soldier tougher, coarser and fiercer than a French soldier. Nicknamed 'Poilu', which means 'hairy' because of their abundant moustache or beard, they are experienced in hand to hand combat, using melee weapons when they run out of ammunition.

      STR_ITALIAN_SOLDIER_INTRODUCTION: The Daring Ones
      STR_ITALIAN_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: Italy, until the beginning of the Great War, has been characterized as a predominantly agricultural and peaceful country. With the arrival of the Martians and the subsequent invasion of Europe, the Italian army has been mobilized.

      STR_SOLDIER_CLASSES_INTRODUCTION: "Soldier Classes"
      STR_SOLDIER_CLASSES_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "The advent of the large scale conflicts meant a focus in the specialization of the training given to the military units. And in this industrialized war, this was further pushed by the members of the Coalition. The result is a series of 'Soldier Classes', each one with a particular set of skills. These soldiers are often assigned to special support regiments, complementing the larger armies fighting the invaders. Also, in separate combat teams like our Force. The IEF is given professional soldiers from each one of the Coalition military special forces, both to bolster our offensive capabilities and a show of unity among nations."
      STR_INFANTRY_CLASS_INTRODUCTION: "Infantry Class Introduction"
      STR_INFANTRY_CLASS_INTRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "While not exactly a class per se, the vast majority of enlisted men and women serving in the Coalition armed forces fall under this group.

      STR_PHLOGISTON_DISCOVERY_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "An energy-based weapons development team led by Dr. Nospmoht and Dr. Rafal Wizniewsky have announced the refinement of their thermal energy emitter devices nicknamed 'Phlogiston' (after the old physics theory that explains why things burn). Using cylindrical-shaped rods made of ruby, their device is able to project a large amount of energy towards a target. Prototypes are still being developed, as the main issue is the extreme overheating and subsequent melting of the projector."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PROTOTYPE_TESTING_EVENT: "Phlogiston prototype testing ongoing"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_PROTOTYPE_TESTING_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The Nospmoht-Wizniewsky Project have managed to make a working prototype. Using a bolt-action service rifle as basis for the 'ruby rod emitter', with the ignition mechanism converted into an energy release mechanism, and the barrel replaced with a large array of magnifying glasses.

      STR_PHLOGISTON_BREAKTHROUGH_EVENT: "Nospmoht-Wizniewsky Project made breakthrough"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_BREAKTHROUGH_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "Today, a major research development was made by the Nospmoht-Wizniewsky Project: a fully working Phlogiston beam weapon. The difficulty to mount the ruby rod emitter mechanism on a brand new gun was ingeniously solved by Sir Nathan Curry, who came up with the idea of using surplus weapons as basis. The blueprints and emitters were sent to several allied forces with the intention of getting as many Phlogiston weapons in the field as possible, meanwhile industrial facilities are adapted to manufacture and dispatch them."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_BLUEPRINTS_EVENT: "Beam Committee presents blueprints"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_BLUEPRINTS_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The Nospmoht-Wizniewsky Project has been very successful in their task to develop energetic weapons and was expanded into the newly formed 'Energy-Beam Weaponry and Technology Development Committee' led by Dr Nospmoht and Sir Nathan Curry, nicknamed 'the Beam Committee'. Their task is to further create powered emitters to use in the war. Dr Rafal Wizniewsky's absence is notorious, however. There is no official statement by the committee on the matter."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_INFANTRY_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT: "Phlogiston Infantry Weapon developed"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_INFANTRY_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The general consensus of the Beam Committee has decided to focus the resources  on the refinement of a standard issue rifle for the Coalition's soldiers. A design was developed with an emphasis on the hellish conditions of the trenches, and new models with their batteries have been sent to key positions in the front. Armories all over the allied nations have started to produce the weapons and new Czchoralski Ruby Incubators have been built to keep the synthetic ruby gems supplies running."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HANDHELD_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT: "Phlogiston Handheld Weapon developed"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HANDHELD_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "As requested by several officers and support unit elements in the Coalition armed forces, a compact side weapon was created. Forging refraction lenses small enough to fit inside a handgun barrel was difficult, and the result was a slightly heavier pistol than conventional desings. Still, it's very appreciated by the commanding officers on the front. Blueprints have been sent to factories and armories."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_SUPPORT_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT: "Phlogiston Support Weapon developed"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_SUPPORT_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "We had recieved word of the usefulness of Phlogiston Pistols in the military leadership, although support troops have requested yet another weapon to complement their duties. Their motives are the need of a compact yet powerful weapon, with more range than a pistol, but shorter and lighter to a rifle. The solution: adapt existing M1907 carbine with Ruby Rod Chambers. The result was well recieved and production has began."
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HEAVY_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT: "Phlogiston Heavy Weapon developed"
      STR_PHLOGISTON_HEAVY_WEAPON_DEVELOPMENT_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The brute firepower of the Nospmoht-Wizniewsky Phlogiston Prototype isn't matched by the battery-powered Beam weapons. So, the solution is to scale up the Ruby Rod Emitter and mechanisms used by the Prototype to a larger frame, making a very powerful heavy rifle. The downside is the slower rate of fire and greatly increased weight and cumberness of the use. The increased demand of the ruby rods may reduce the availablity of the weapon."

      STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: "Also called 'Martian Metal', this is an exotic mineral alloy used by the Martians to build everything, from small weapons to ship armor. Chemically speaking, most of the components are already found in Earth, but our attempts at reproducing haven't been successful... Yet. Slightly lighter than steel, but considerably denser and durable, it requieres high pressure and heat to be able to be mold.  Named after Tunguska, the first recorded Martian Landing Zone of the Great War"
      STR_ELERIUM_115: "Hydrogen Fuel Cell"
      STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "Hydrogen was first recognized as a distinct element by Henry Cavendish in 1766. Our scientists theorize its the most abundant element in the universe. It's also the fuel that burns inside the Sun. The Martians employ said Fuel Cells to harness great amounts of electrical power using a source of hydrogen gas. Cheap and clean energy."
      STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE: "Hydrogen Acceleration Engine"
      STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The exact method how this device works was theorized by a research team led by E. Rutherford and A. Eddington: after several years of studying the wreck of the power sources within the first Tripods, it was found that inside the Engine two atoms of hydrogen combine together to form an atom of helium. In the process some of the mass of the hydrogen is converted into energy. This process is highly efficient and can powers from the smallest weapon to the largest Fighting-Machines... and also our own vehicles, although we are limited to adapting the invader's Engines, as we're currently unable to produce them on our own."
      STR_UFO_NAVIGATION: "Martian Navigation Device"
      STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "A rather interesting Martian device, its used to control their machines. Instead of using levers and handlebars or steering wheels, the pilot commands the movements of the vehicle by directly moving their fingers within a specially adapted 'command table', pretty much how a puppeteer moves a marionette. This, of course, was easily learnt by the human crew within our Walkers."
      STR_ALIEN_FOOD: "Martian Food Container"
      STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "The stinky vats are filled to the top in a unpleasant, goo-like substance. Inside we can see the partially digested remains of what seems like cattle or other large mammals and alien-like animals. But we don't doubt there could be human remains floating within the disgusting soup. We believe this mixture is the main nutritional supplement used by the invaders and most likely how they got their antibodies."
      STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION: "Martian Tissue Incubator"
      STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "It seems the enemy relies on creating cloned copies of their own kind for medical purposes. Replacement limbs and organs, most likely. This small chamber is used to grow a Martian, and when needed, its murdered and the spare parts added with surgery on the wounded "
      STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT: "Martian Radio Transmitter"
      STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "These alien devices seem to be used to transmit orders, commands and several other communications from the leader caste towards the lesser beings. Directly into the brains. Probably even unwilling. We could think of said devices as the perfect propaganda machine."
      STR_ALIEN_SURGERY: "Martian Surgery Tools"
      STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: "The only purpose we have identified for this weird set of tools so far, is their use in conducting gruesome surgeries and tissue extractions on both Earth and Martian species. It serves both as butchering and medical treatment equipment. Only a truly cruel mind could design such unnerving piece of machiner."
      STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM: "Examination Room"

      STR_MARTIAN_FORCE_FIELDS: "Martian Force Fields"
      STR_MARTIAN_FORCE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA: "The largest Martian machines are protected by an invisible shield. It absorbs some of the energy of our weapons, 'bouncing' it away from the machine. It seems it's adapted to resist large amounts of thermal radiation, like those emitted by high explosive rounds; perhaps learning from their experience with our artillery barrages early in the Great War. Our experts theorize kinetic energy is considerably harder to absorb and disperse than light or heat, since it has the inertia of mass behind it. This is why high-velocity ammo concentrated on small area of the force field seems to overload the generator, disabling it and breaking the shields."

      STR_MARTIAN_BLOOD_EXTRACTOR_UFOPEDIA: "This unnerving 'tool' is often used by the enemy in harvesting operations. Basically a glorified syringe, the large lance-like piece is impaled directly into the body of the victim. The guts and blood are then drained and stored in a flask behind the Extractor, in a truly gruesome fashion. Very often, the victim is left bleeding to death as result of the violent procedure. The range is limited, but it ignores completely any kind of armor if it hits."

      STR_MARTIAN_SLUGTHROWER_UFOPEDIA: "Nicknamed 'the Blunderbuss', due the similarities with the old human weapon. It is the clearest example the Martians are learning from our designs... and also running low on resources. As opposed to their usually advanced weapons, this ballistic gun has a simple design with varying degrees of quality. The Slugthrower is a breechloader, single shot, bolt-action rifle, similar to the weapons used in late 19th Century.  It uses an unknown pressurized gas to propel small Tunguskium slugs at high parabolic trajectories over long distances. Equipped with a bayonet."

      STR_GENEVA_CONVENTION_APPEAL: "Hague Convention Appeal"
      STR_GENEVA_CONVENTION_APPEAL_UFOPEDIA: "Even after all these years of non-stop fighting all around the world, it seems the Hague Convention of 1899 is still a thing. Until now, the use of certain types of ammunition and weapons were banned in war... against humans. But as fas as we know, the Martians didn't signed the Convention. This sole argument was enough to have said restrictions lifted for all combating forces. New special unconventional equipment is available."

      STR_HEATRAY_PHOTON_ANALYSIS: "Heat-Ray Photon Batteries"
      STR_HEATRAY_PHOTON_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Since the first appearance of the Tripods on English soil, humanity has been attracted and horrified by the main war weapon of the invaders. They use an unknown crystal as a catalyst for the energy emitted by a miniature Hydrogen Engine that projects a powerful infrared ray (called 'Photon Beam' by most people) at more than 1500 degrees centigrade. We have analyzed these weapons carefully and are quite useless without the crystal, basically a gas lamp with alien batteries."
      STR_HEATRAY_MICROWAVE_ANALYSIS: "Heat-Ray Microwave Batteries"
      STR_HEATRAY_MICROWAVE_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The enemy is learning from us, pretty much as we learn from they. It's something we cannot stop. The shock troop tactics so widely used by the Coalition troop and extremely effective in stopping the enemy advance in 1913 may have inspired the Martians on doing the same. This new set of Microwave emitters is focused towards maximum damage spread in a wide area. Essentially an energy shotgun! Our theories about the modularity of the weapons were confirmed, however. We need to continue developing further research to keep up the pace of the technological war. "

      STR_HEATRAY_WEAPONS_ANALYSIS: "Heat-Ray Infantry Weapon Analysis"
      STR_HEATRAY_WEAPONS_ANALYSIS_UFOPEDIA: "The enemy armament evolved from the first invasion. Now they have designed and used smaller weapons and use them massively. Considerably weaker than those used by Fighting Machines, they are still very lethal for unprotected humans. One important feature seems to be the possibility of getting modular upgrades, as we noticed that the weapons have a thread similar to a screw, which could be used to adapt new types of attachments still unknown. Our scientist confirmed that handguns are simply impossible to replicate or use by our soldiers. We can sell them to our allies to try to recycle their components."
      STR_RED_WEED_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The martian indigenous crop, better known as 'Red Weed' is a highly invasive root species, capable of covering all types of terrestrial terrain with relative ease. This generates the perfect habit for the Martians, which suggests that they are terraforming our planet to make it more like Mars. It seems that the blood of mammals serves as fertilizer for this ominous plant. It is said to give off a highly fetid stench, similar to decaying cattle."
      STR_CHEMICAL_WARFARE_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The chemical weaponry has been used since the First Martian Invasion in 1898 in the form of the Black Smoke. In this war it has also been used with ferocity, decimating our armies and cities. A detailed analysis of the chemical containers of the Martians reveal a mixture of iron-rich powder with what appears to be dehydrated Red Weed, which gives it its dark color. It is the maximum weapon of enemy siege, although we can investigate the way to use it against them."
      STR_HEATRAY_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Heat-Ray Rifle fires an intense infrared beam and uses a large and heavy Hydrogen Cell battery. This weapon has a limited shot capacity, so this weapon needs to be reloaded often. It is balanced in terms of damage, range and accuracy. Based on our analysis, the extended use of this weapon without proper maintaining may damage the internal components and explode in the hands of it's operators.
      STR_HEATRAY_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA: Smaller version of the Heat-Ray Rifle, this weapon is more like an human Carbine, although it is light enough to be used with one hand. Best used by the enemy at close range. It's batery has the largest energy capacity of all of the Martian hand weapons.
      STR_HEATRAY_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: Short handgun made by the Martians, it is often used as a support weapon, but some troops seems to have a preference on its use. It uses a large battery with many energy capacity and it is light enough to be used with just one hand.
      STR_HEATRAY_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: This Heat-Ray Hand Cannon is used as a heavy weapon for the Martian infantry. Sufficiently powerful to melt several layers of steel with a concentrated beam at medium-short range. We believe that the batteries of these weapons last a short time.
      STR_HEATRAY_SNIPER_UFOPEDIA: The Heat-Ray Sniper is the most dangerous portable weapon in the arsenal of the invader infantry. Maybe it is not as powerful as the Hand Cannon, but it has much more accuracy and effective range. The sight seems to be synchronized with the eyes of the Martian soldiers, it is useless to try to look through it.
      STR_MARTIAN_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: Powerful grenade launcher type weapon, used by the Martians to provoke fear and loathing between the humans, civilians and soldiers alike. The Black Smoke grenade, used in the First Invasion, suffocates and chokes a human when enters the respiratoy system, slowly rendering inmobile, but it's spread is low. The technology of this weapon seems to be different from that of the rest of the Martian weapons, perhaps of a design of another extraterrestrial race.
      STR_MARTIAN_ROCK_THROWER_UFOPEDIA: "This interesting weapon looks more like a tool than a weapon. It has 3 barrels in vertical position, connected to 3 flasks with 3 small projectiles inside. It seems that each projectile exits at the same time through each barrel. It works similar to a human shotgun, with projectiles from a mineral that burns quickly with oxygen called Calystene, in honor of its discoverer. It also has small capsules of toxic sleeping pill gas and an acidic material that melts organic tissue. It seems that this tool is designed to cleanse from flora and fauna on their newly reclamed land"

      STR_UNIVERSAL_TRANSLATION_DEVICE: "Universal Translation Device"
      STR_UNIVERSAL_TRANSLATION_DEVICE_UFOPEDIA: "The deceased crew members of the unidentified ship managed to communicate with the human soldiers in their native language until before their death. Our scientists and engineers believe it is possible to repair this device using similar parts found on Fighting-Machines, which will allow us to communicate with the enemy and any other aliens we encounter. If this works, it will perhaps be the most important breakthrough of the entire war."
      STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT: "Contention Chamber"
      STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Special chamber prepared to interrogate Martian prisoners of war. At the center of the room is a universal translation device that allows converting human languages into the various guttural sounds emitted by extraterrestrials and vice versa."
      
      STR_MARTIAN_CONSCRIPT_INTERROGATION: "Martian Conscript Interrogation Report"
      STR_MARTIAN_CONSCRIPT_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "The interogations of Martian conscripts have proven two things first and foremost. First, they hold nothing useful and should either be sold off or executed. Second is that they are pulled from whatever jobs they work on Mars and thrown into combat with minimal training. The Martian I had the displeasure of interrogating was experiencing Shell Shock, constantly looking somewhere far away and fearful of loud, sudden noises. It even seems to be experiencing auditory hallucinations, begging us to stop 'Shooting the Big boom guns' at it. This demonstrates the effectiveness of bombardment at wreaking havoc on soldiers, and I suggest we introduce methods to prevent this from happening to our troops in the future."
      
      STR_MARTIAN_LINE_INFANTRY_INTERROGATION: "Martian Line Infantry Interrogation Report"
      STR_MARTIAN_LINE_INFANTRY_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "The martian Line Infantry are of the warrior race, larger and more acclimated to warfare. Unlike the Conscripts most commonly seen on the battlefield, these soldiers were bred and raised for combat. Yet they lack the skills to perform most other tasks, if our interpretations are correct. This specimen is unable to learn any Human language, and we had to opt to drawings and our limited understanding of their language. It lacks the fine motor skills to do detailed drawings, but can master the loading of a foreign machine gun within hours. These soldiers likely were created specifically for this conflict, and as such show no chance of resisting the war."
      STR_MARTIAN_MARINE_INTERROGATION: "Martian Marine Interrogation Report"
      STR_MARTIAN_MARINE_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "These Martians are part of the Warrior race, bred for generations to be effective soldiers. They serve as marines, used to establish beach heads and operate out of Martian ships and walkers. They are brutally efficient, and far better at camouflage then any other Martians. They also have a greater amount of creativity than standard Line infantryman, able to react to complex situations much faster without officers leading them. They are formidable foes, and should be the focus of any frontline troops during battle."
      STR_MARTIAN_SKIRMISHER_INTERROGATION: "Martian Skirmisher Interrogation Report"
      STR_MARTIAN_SKIRMISHER_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "These Martian Skirmishers are not members of the warrior race, despite their names hinting at it. They are Workers that were selected for this role due to greater independence and good eyesight. They are then given proper training on soldiering, before promptly being sent into the front lines. Based on both action in the field and this interrogation it is clear that there existed little support for skirmisher training before the war. We have theorized that this is due to it bringing dishonor to the warior race, but have no confirmations for this. Regardless of the cause, this has led to us having a greater ability to outflank the enemy forces and lay effective ambushes."

###### OVERLORDS AND COLLABORATION FINALE ######
###############################################
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_1: "Overlord Intel I - Our enemy"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_1_UFOPEDIA: "This type of Martian is a widely identified caste since the First Invasion. Very little is known about them, however. Their resemblance to brain-like cephalopods is unnerving, with a major characteristic of them is a 'beak' in the middle of the 'eyes'. Something similar to 'mental powers' have been identified in specimens found in combat. This 'Overlord' is too deteriorated to get information out of it, although it is the first one we have had face to face... alive, at least."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_2: "Overlord Intel II - Hierarchy"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_2_UFOPEDIA: "The enemy rank hierarchy is different from ours, but this Martian seems to be the direct equivalent of a Commander, in charge of a large group of troops. Invaders operate in social castes and these are the top of the pyramid. Perhaps this comparative is appropriate, considering their affinity for such a geometric shape. Our interrogations are progressing, we suggest we continue with the capture of these Martian leaders."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_3: "Overlord Intel III - Metalurgy"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_3_UFOPEDIA: "We find the conversational fluency of this 'Overlord' highly unusual. The translator recovered from the crash on British soil seems to be perfectly in sync with the prisoner's language. We have obtained vital information concerning the chemical composition of the Martian Metal and have distributed it to the scientific community for replication."
      STR_MARTIAN_METAL_REPLICATION: "Tunguskium Replication"
      STR_MARTIAN_METAL_REPLICATION_UFOPEDIA: The recently captured leader was more... cooperative. They revealed to us that they are running out of resources to build new Tripods and war machines. In fact, the Walkers that ravaged London in 1896 and those used between 1911 and 1912 were almost twice as tough as the ones we face. The reason is that the reserves of Martian Metal carried by the Cylinders were exhausted and they have had to manufacture more. We have most of the minerals that exist on Mars, but the invaders do not have their modern manufacturing systems to replicate them accurately. This causes their machines and armor to use lower quality metal. We now know that we can replicate Tunguskium almost exactly and use it to our advantage. The formula has been sent to steel mills all over the world.
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_4: "Overlord Intel IV - Menacing message"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_4_UFOPEDIA: "The most recent interrogation did not go well. Our agents were incapacitated after reporting hallucinations and loss of consciousness. The prisoner attempted to escape, but stopped outside the lab. They made a series of noises and was shot by base guards. The translator caught a glimpse of their words before they died: 'We are intrigued. We are watching.'' Our scientific staff recommends continuing to capture and interrogate individuals of this caste."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_5: "Overlord Intel V - They're different"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_5_UFOPEDIA: "This prisoner has been more cooperative. They has explained to us that their species is different from the infantry we have faced since 1911. Grey humanoids are the most abundant caste, but it seems that their intelligence is rather limited. The interview was abruptly interrupted when an armed guard burst into the room and shot the prisoner at point blank range. Our scientists agree that the minds of 'Overlords' emit an inaudible frequency that literally drives insane certain particularly sensitive higher mammals. That could explain sudden bursts of hysteria on the front lines. The information we get is invaluable, we suggest continuing the interrogations."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_6: "Overlord Intel VI - Civil war"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_6_UFOPEDIA: "Keeping with the previous objective of digging further into the hierarchical structure of the enemy, we have obtained from this POW more information on its history. Mars was plunged into a civil war between various castes. It nearly wiped out all life on the red planet until the Overlord caste gained control. And it seems that they mentally subdued the others. We believe that the purpose of their genocidal campaign on our planet is to hold the other castes together for a common purpose."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_7: "Overlord Intel VII - Lesser beings"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_7_UFOPEDIA: "We continue to get information from the Overlords. They are becoming more and more cooperative, much to our surprise. The Overlords are able to exert their telepathic 'powers' on weak minds, but capable of rational thought. They cannot control plants, insects or bacteria. At least, not terrestrial ones. Much of their brain capacity is devoted to subduing others. This leads us to believe that eliminating or capturing one greatly reduces the enemy's military coordination."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_8: "Overlord Intel VIII - Ancient visitors"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_8_UFOPEDIA: "Martians, both of the leading caste as well as warriors and workers, have visited our planet on numerous occasions. This confirms the relationship of the pyramids of the ancient world with extraterrestrial beings. Although it seems that we inspired them to create pyramids. The Martians are an ancient species, although their rise began about the same time as the Roman Empire reached its peak."
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_9: "Overlord Intel XI - Truth unveiled"
      STR_OVERLORD_INTEL_9_UFOPEDIA: "The latest interrogation has unveiled a half-hidden 'truth'. Life exists on other planets in the Solar System, not just Earth and Mars. Venus, the Jovian and Saturnian moons… We are one more house in a long neighborhood. And it seems that the war has affected everyone. The Mars-led faction fights against the Jovian faction. Apparently the front lines are in the asteroid belt and right on the moons of Jupiter. This Overlord has expressed to us their race's interest in our planet and now in ourselves. And they informs us that their leaders want to contact ours."
      STR_MARTIANS_SEEKS_DIPLOMACY_EVENT: "Martians seeks diplomacy"
      STR_MARTIANS_SEEKS_DIPLOMACY_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "A Flying-Machine has landed near our base undetected. A group of Overlords and their escorts are approaching our base commander. Their intention is to negotiate a truce and offer an alliance. They have entered the complex and we will begin talks shortly."
      STR_MARTIAN_OVERLORD_DIPLOMACY: "Emergency diplomatic meeting at our base"
      STR_MARTIAN_OVERLORD_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA: "Representatives of all Coalition nations are present, as well as the Martian leaders. The makeshift meeting room hosts our translator. The leader of the alien retinue informs us that their planet is at war with the Outer Planets and they need our help. We have proven to be a formidable opponent. Losing an Overlord is a tragedy for them, but we are the first planet that has managed to capture nive. Not even the 'Jovians', their worst enemies, have managed it. If we accept the proposal of a truce and join them in their war, they will immediately cease attacks against Earth and help us create ships capable of traveling to Jupiter and beyond. If we refuse, they will continue their genocidal campaign and wipe us off the face of the planet to seize its resources and keep their war machine running. The Coalition leaders cast their votes and it looks like the final decision rests with us."

      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_1: "We accepted the proposal of the invader. Immediately, all Martian attacks stopped and in many places, the Grey infantry laid down their arms."
      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_2: "Earth's population received the news mixed. Many people and important political figures accepted the change and were grateful that the carnage on the front lines was stopped."
      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_3: "Others, however, saw this as a stab in the back. The whole war had been futile. The enemy was still on our planet. The Red Weed still covered large tracts of land and is not going away. There are protests in several cities."
      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_4: "Martian engineers have been allowed to learn in detail the inner workings of our weapons and vehicles. Most have been adapted for space combat. Our armor now includes special respirators for operating in alien atmospheres."
      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_5: "Gigantic cannons have been built all over the equator, similar to those used to launch invasion Cylinders."
      STR_COLLABORATION_FINALE_6: "Our men and women now float in space, bound for a war we do not understand.	Against an enemy we do not know. Only time will tell if we make the right decision."

      STR_TRUCE_REJECTED_EVENT: "Truce Rejected"
      STR_TRUCE_REJECTED_EVENT_DESCRIPTION: "The answer was resounding. No. Humanity will not negotiate with the enemy that has slaughtered millions and poisoned the planet. As a courtesy, we have allowed the Martian representatives to withdraw without firing a shot. But we can expect the fighting to get worse. However, the news has been well received by the populace and more volunteers have shown up at the recruiting offices."

      STR_DEFEAT_FINALE_1: "Despite our best efforts, we have lost. Not even the mightiest nations and the greatest minds alive combined could avoid the inevitable. "
      STR_DEFEAT_FINALE_2: "The negotiations were short. Earth is now another colony of the Martian tyranny."
      STR_DEFEAT_FINALE_3: "One third of the remaining population was brainwashed to serve in the alien military, just like the Selenites. The other two thirds are used to feed the Martians. Huge cannons send human troops to fight in the enemy's wars in the outer solar system. It was clear they would involve us in their conflicts one way or another."
      STR_DEFEAT_FINALE_4: "The human spirit won't be completely broken, as there are still armed resistance hiding underground, harassing the invaders with guerrilla warfare."
      STR_DEFEAT_FINALE_5: "The relative calm didn't last long, though. Some months after the surrendering of mankind, cylinders fell again to Earth, this time full of Jovians and their allies. Our planet became just another frontline in a forever war we didn't wanted to be part. "

      STR_ALIENS_ONLY: "Martians Only"

      STR_LEADER_INTEL_1: "Leader Intel I - Martian Army"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_1_UFOPEDIA: "The Tripods that attacked England at the turn of the last century turned out to be simple exploration machines. By the time the enemy launched the global attack in 1911, we realized that there were far worse Martian machines. However, unlike the First Invasion, there is a significant reduction of armored elements in the enemy armies. And on the contrary, there are more infantry deployed. The captured leader didn't gave us any more information, but it seems that Tripods are expensive and difficult to maintain."
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_2: "Leader Intel II - Operational thinking"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_2_UFOPEDIA: "'Special diplomacy' is particularly effective in obtaining information. The enemy leader revealed information from the Martian war formations. The walkers are powerful machines, but like us humans, the enemy army's forte is based on infantry. Apparently, the vanguard in a major operation is always composed of several squads of reconnaissance Tripods. It is similar to our operations, they always carry a powerful artillery barrage prior to the assault. And once the occupation zone is cemented, infantry is deployed for control and stabilization. Apparently, the Martians feel confident on our planet and have underestimated our troops. Serious mistake that they will pay dearly for."
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_3: "Leader Intel III - Civilization"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_3_UFOPEDIA: "Martians are a species that inhabits pyramid-like structures. They live their entire lives in such 'Hive cities.' They have a caste system but each Martian is an individual. There are warrior castes, workers' houses, scientists' houses, miners' houses. Apparently, Martians have a caste defined by their family. This means that many times the warrior Martians are descendants of long military families."
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_4: "Leader Intel IV - Sheer numbers"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_4_UFOPEDIA: "The war-focused castes are less numerous than the worker castes. Although the warriors belonging to the armed forces are numerous, our estimate on the knowledge collected by the interrogations indicates that the non-warrior castes outnumber the military castes 10 to 1. That is why we have seen that the so-called 'Conscripts' are so abundant. We do not know if the fact that they are employed on the front line indicates that the Martian military reserves are short of soldiers."
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_5: "Leader Intel V - Civil war"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_5_UFOPEDIA: "The Invaders are Conquerors by nature, based on knowledge gained from interrogations we have understood that they are in a state of perpetual warfare. It seems that an indeterminate amount of time ago, there was a bloody Civil War between the various castes. Apparently, a superior caste unified the planet and organized it against other civilizations. Which ones? When? It is not known. Apparently, this is all the caste leaders know. Further information seems to be restricted for most castes, which leads us to believe that their ignorance is planned."
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_6: "Leader Intel VI - Other enemy"
      STR_LEADER_INTEL_6_UFOPEDIA: "Apparently, there is every reason to believe that we are not the only enemies of the Martians. Whoever they were, they are very old. The war has been going on for a long time, no one remembers how it started anymore. According to what we are told by the Martian leaders questioned, the technology employed by Mars (i.e. Heat Rays) are particularly effective against this ancient enemy of unknown origin, beings that seem to bear a resemblance to Earth's sea species. Interestingly, they are susceptible to temperature changes. We have no way of knowing their origin or location."

      STR_LEADER_6: "Leader Unlock 6"


      STR_SECTOID_LEADER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Gray Bipedal-Martian is slightly different from the others. Its skin tissue looks older and scarred. This individual's brain and eyes more appear to be slightly more developed than those of his congeners, which may be a sign that his social standing superior to other members of his caste."
      STR_MARTIAN_SHOCK_GUARD_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "The officers and elite leaders of the enemy army are also assigned the best armor available in the Martian arsenal. They are the equivalent of a commissioned officer and they command large numbers of troops. The red dye on their armor is obtained from the Red Weed, similarly that worn by their subordinates."

      STR_MARTIAN_OUTPOST: "Martian Outpost"
      STR_MARTIAN_OUTPOST_UFOPEDIA: "This outpost is a small base set up to monitor the movement of humans and spy on them. It also serves to protect and warn the most important installations in the event of an attack. It has a small garrison."
      STR_MARTIAN_TROOP_BARRACKS: "Martian Troop Barracks" # Troop Facility
      STR_MARTIAN_TROOP_BARRACKS_UFOPEDIA: "This fortress houses a large number of soldiers, has 4 defensive AA cannons, an armory, infirmary and a strong armor. It is usually the most abundant Martian facility, used to guard large portions of land and deploy assault groups, as well as secure key positions."
      STR_MARTIAN_HARVEST_FACILITY: "Martian Harvesting Facility"
      STR_MARTIAN_HARVEST_FACILITY_UFOPEDIA: "A sinister Martian facility used to dissect living beings, such as animals and humans, to create food and conduct research on terrestrial species. All abducted humans end up in one way or another in centers like these"

      STR_MARTIAN_WATCHTOWER_UFOPEDIA: "An important bastion, used both to defend important sectors and to dissuade human troops from launching offensives in Martian territory. Its anti-aircraft batteries are quite powerful, capable of destroying human planes over long distances."
      STR_MARTIAN_HIGH_COMMAND: "Martian High Command" # Alien High Command
      STR_MARTIAN_HIGH_COMMAND_UFOPEDIA: "The brain of the Martian operation on land, from here are coordinated various attacks and offensives against human targets. The highest leaders of the enemy take refuge in these gigantic structures, with hundreds of soldiers. Their anti-aircraft batteries are quite efficient and their armour is extremely hard."
      STR_MARTIAN_SUPPLY_DEPOT: "Martian Supply Depot" # Storage Facility
      STR_MARTIAN_SUPPLY_DEPOT_UFOPEDIA: "A support facility, the purpose of which is to store the various war materials, such as weaponry, food, supplies and tools necessary for the enemy's total war machine. They are extremely hard, but they are poorly armed."
      STR_MARTIAN_CLONE_LAB: "Martian Organics Lab" # Cloning Lab
      STR_MARTIAN_CLONE_LAB_UFOPEDIA: "Martian scientific and research centres, closely related to Harvesting Facilities. They use genetic material obtained from Martian butchery to create and increase the quality of clones to generate more food for their ranks and make replacement limbs for their wounded. They also make organic tissue plates made of Red Weed to build warships and other Flying-Machines."
      STR_MARTIAN_REDOUBT: "Martian Redoubt"
      STR_MARTIAN_REDOUBT_UFOPEDIA: "The supreme Martian fortress. The existence of these gigantic facilities can only mean that the enemy is prepared for a total siege. They have the best anti-aircraft weapons, the best shields and armour and an enormous number of military and scientific personnel. Assaulting a Redoubt can be a hard blow for the Martians, but it is an almost suicidal mission."

      STR_HEAT_RAY_TECH_PHOTON: "Scientist Intel I - Heat-Ray Photon"
      STR_HEAT_RAY_TECH_PHOTON_UFOPEDIA: "The captured scientists have defined that their weapons are powered by the 'energy of the central star'. That is, our Sun. There are certain studies that refer to the splitting of the atom and its subsequent release of electromagnetic energy (which can be channeled as thermal energy). The research team led by Lord Rutherford confirm this to be an indication of the existence of artificial nuclear fusion. Further proof of the enemy's enormous technological advantage, but one that we can use to our advantage."
      STR_HEAT_RAY_TECH_MICROWAVE: "Scientist Intel II - Heat-Ray Microwave"
      STR_HEAT_RAY_TECH_MICROWAVE_UFOPEDIA: The enemy tries to adapt their technology as the war progresses, much like us. Martian scientists work tirelessly to stay ahead of the curve, and one of their greatest advances is the use of new weapons technologies. Instead of using concentrated photons, they are switching to microwave radiation. More dangerous and with a larger scattering angle. Their weapons can modify their emitters with the ease of changing batteries.
      STR_HUMAN_HARVEST_1: "Scientist Intel III - Human harvest"
      STR_HUMAN_HARVEST_1_UFOPEDIA: "It is not clear to us how it is possible for the Martians to extract any sustenance from terrestrial organisms or whether this dependence began from the Second Invasion of 1911, the First Invasion of 1896 or earlier. The captured scientist has told us that the aliens' acquired immunity comes from the constant infusion of human and cattle blood into their bodies. Apparently it is some kind of vaccine to fit them to our ecosystem and without it, they would quickly perish."
      STR_HUMAN_HARVEST_2: "Scientist Intel IV - Bloody obsession"
      STR_HUMAN_HARVEST_2_UFOPEDIA: "This imprisoned scientist has given us more details about the apparent Martian obsession with blood. The blood of mammals contains hemoglobin in large quantities, which is composed of iron. Iron plays an important role in Martian metabolism and is very abundant on Mars, so blood is a good source of nutrients. Combined with the fact that they are better immunized against terrestrial diseases, many Martian soldiers travel with vials of blood."
      STR_MARTIAN_TERRAFORMATION: "Scientist Intel V - Symbiotic relationship"
      STR_MARTIAN_TERRAFORMATION_UFOPEDIA: "Mars is a dying world. Although it has numerous mineral deposits, organic and food production is very limited because of the difficult climate. It seems that Earth's climate is more suitable for the flourishing of its flora, the well-known Red Weed. The symbiotic relationship it has with the inhabitants of the red planet is more important than we think... it provides food for the Martians and gives them vitality."
      STR_ORGANIC_FLYING_MACHINES: "Scientist Intel VI - Organic horrors"
      STR_ORGANIC_FLYING_MACHINES_UFOPEDIA: "The enemy scientist has revealed that their civilization considers it 'an aberration' that we have adapted their technology to create our own machines. That is why they have devoted great efforts to create new machines that we can never replicate: 'living mechanisms'. We can't figure out if they are breeding space beasts or using their tissues to build ships. Either way, the result sounds terrifying."
      STR_BIOLOGICAL_WARFARE: "Biological Warfare"
      STR_BIOLOGICAL_WARFARE_UFOPEDIA: "Now we have the Hague Convention restricitons lifted, we can conduct a yet-to-be-approved series of biological and chemical studies focused on studying the enemy's weakness and more importantly, how to kill them quickly. After we have identified their symbiotic relationship with the Red Weed, we can explore new ways to weaponize viral or bacterial agents on our favor. An allied science team has proposed a new bio-weapon codenamed 'Firestorm', we could help them with their studies using our knowledge of the Martian biology."
      STR_OPERATION_FIRESTORM: "Operation Firestorm"
      STR_OPERATION_FIRESTORM_UFOPEDIA: "A highly experimental strain of the hepatitis virus was created, aimed to disrup the inmune system of the infected and their liver. This is transmitted through blood and other body fluids. After capturing the infected mammals, the Martians will caught the sickness and develop it. Eventually, their inmune systems will be compromised again and they'll die even with the lightest flu. This may have a chance of infecting humans as well, because we are one of the vectors of the infection. While a large portion of the international medical community has their concerns, we don't have any choice. The war does not seems to have an end soon. This may be our last chance of winning it. As a safety measure, we have developed a vaccine too. Just in case. "

      STR_SCIENTIST_1: "Scientist Unlock 1"
      STR_LAUNCH_FIRESTORM: "Launch Operation Firestorm"
      STR_PYRRIC_VICTORY_FINALE_1: "Our most secretive biological weapon was released, widely distributed over the Martian Occupation Zones using specially modified airplanes. Several of them were shot down, but most managed to accomplish their task."
      STR_PYRRIC_VICTORY_FINALE_2: "The result was expected... the enemy didn't noticed they were collecting infected bodies and directly feeding with the Firestorm virus. In a matter of weeks, most of them became sick and fell. The activity in the frontlines ceased."
      STR_PYRRIC_VICTORY_FINALE_3: "However, the virus mutated. We couldn't prevent it, as our vaccines were ineffective of this new strain. Combined with a sudden outbreak of influenza, the mortality rate was increased among both Martian and Human populations. Dead are counted by hundreds of thousands."
      STR_PYRRIC_VICTORY_FINALE_4: "The year's 1920. The last remaining outbreaks of Firestorm virus ended almost a year ago. A third of the whole mankind perished with the sickness or the influenza. But so do our enemy. There's not a single trace of any living Martian left. Our planet will be forever scarred and it is all our fault. No enemy, local or outsider, will ever dare to attack us... as we are more than capable to sacrifice ourselves in order to achieve victory."

Most modern models are monoplanes, making it easier to achieve higher speeds and reduce drag."

      STR_LANDSHIP_DATA: "Landship Data"
      STR_LANDSHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "Land vessels are easily recognizable by their elongated chassis and tracks that run the length of the chassis. Their greatest advantage is their low profile and strength. Compared to Walkers, they are mechanically easier and cheaper to maintain. They are limited to fighting on plains and deserts, since their mobility is very limited in difficult terrain. Large amounts of infantry are carried inside the armored vehicle, both as gunners and infantry ferried to the battle zones."
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_1: "Landship History I"
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_1_UFOPEDIA: "The concept of the landship began in 1903, when the world famous author Sir Herbert George Wells (widely known for his first-hand account of the First Invasion of 1896) published a scientific paper called 'The Land Ironclads'. In his writing, Sir Wells detailed how future wars could be waged using large armored fighting vehicles similar to warships, but using wheels or caterpillars to transverse the land. The main purpose was to break the unnatural stalemate of the modern warfare and the growing tendency of entrenched armies. Like a force of nature, the land ironclads could ignore any amount of trenches or fortifications, wreacking havoc all over the front... like an ominous mountain of steel and guns."
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_2: "Landship History II"
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_2_UFOPEDIA: "Sir Wells' publication drawed lots of attention towards the prospect of 'land ironclads'. It was Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Almiralty, who promoted the idea among the British high command. After the establishment of the Landship Committee by Navy officers, engineers and politicians in 1905, several designs were made over the course of the years. The major objetive was to create a ground-based arm of the Royal Navy, tasked on protecting His Majesty overseas territories... pretty much an analog of the seaborne fleets. The first prototype, 'Little Willy', was tested in 1909. The design included several different armament, from a 2-pounder Pom Pom gun to a combination of Maxim MGs. However, much of the funding and attention was diverter to the Walker Mech projects, putting the development of a landship to a halt. Blueprints were stored in vaults and the Committee members went to other projects.  "
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_3: "Landship History III"
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_3_UFOPEDIA: "The second coming of the Martians meant a complete change in the development of new war machines. During the interwar period, the new vehicles were seen more as a novelty than a practical use. The blueprints and mockups of the landships were quickly brought back to the table, looking for a machine able to stop the insatiable warmongering enemy. The most sucessful result is the Conqueror landship, seen as more mechanically reliable and cheaper than the Walkers. The initial concept saw the use of sawed-off artillery guns mounted in sponsons all over the chassis, but a 360° rotating turret was selected as a better option.  A 6-pounder naval gun was selected as the main armament, along with several Maxim machine guns as infantry support. The main purpose of the landships was to efficiently transport infantrymen in the hellish battlefields of the Great War. Thanks to it's relatively fast speed and size, they are often nicknamed 'land destroyers'."
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_4: "Landship History IV"
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_4_UFOPEDIA: "The wide use of the Conqueror landships revealed a major flaw: the lack of additional firepower. While a 6-pdr gun and a secundary machine gun may be enough to keep a Martian platoon at bay, larger Machines may put in danger the ground vessels and their crews. Even when the Conqueror vehicle platoons were instructed to travel at least in pairs to bolster the defensive and offensive capabilities, the casualties in the armored regiments were higher than expected. The solution was to enlongate the chassis and put even more weapons and gun turrets. More powerful engines allow the fighting vehicle to mount larger guns and armor plates, along with carry more crewmates, troops and ammunition. The Chieftain landcruisers were recieved with bliss by the armored battalions of the Coalition."
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_5: "Landship History V"
      STR_LANDSHIP_HISTORY_5_UFOPEDIA: "Eventually, the concept of 'putting more and bigger guns' on the landships had to come to an end. And the end, was materialized in the Land Battleship, a large ground vessel with a similar gun turret distribution of a seaborne Navy warship. Four naval guns and several more machine guns are disposed all over the chassis, with powerful threads beneath. The crew is located on top of a bridge tower, granting superior visibility of the warzone. While the land battleship isn't exactly meant to ferry troops, a small contingent onboard could disembark and support the combat operations where the vessel is taking part. The major downside (and possibly the only thing that prevents its deployment in massive numbers) is the large cost of the construction of each ship, both in materials and in money. Thus, few land battleships are actually used by the allied forces."

      STR_WALKER_DATA: "Walker Data"
      STR_WALKER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "Since the initial enemy attack in '96, the image of towering walking machines has been imprinted in the minds and hearts of the world. Our technology has come a long way thanks to the reverse engineering we have applied. However, mechanized walking vehicles (called interchangeably 'walkers' or 'mechs') are more complex to build and maintain than wheeled and tracked vehicles. Their advantage lies in their flexibility in all types of terrain, because they are not limited to roads and flat areas. Mountains, swamps, jungles? There's nothing a mech can't traverse."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_1: "Walker History I"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_1_UFOPEDIA: "The first prototypes were built using scrap and leftover parts from the Martian Tripods used in the 1896 Attack. For 10 years, the United Kingdom and Germany were the countries most focused on adapting the enemy's technology, with varying results. The first working model was presented to the world in London in 1907. The Hague Convention of 1899 forbade the production of 'Walkers' for war purposes, so most were used as a means of transportation."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_2: "Walker History II"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_2_UFOPEDIA: "The impossibility of replicating the triple mechanism of the Martians, together with the unnatural way of moving of their Tripods derived in the abandonment of this design in favor of biped and quadruped units. Centuries of animal locomotion studies were of great help. The leg mechanisms are a hybrid design between an internal diesel and Martian hydrogen reactor combination. The shortage of reactors in optimal condition limits their mass employment."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_3: "Walker History III"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_3_UFOPEDIA: "The most successful and widely distributed Walker model until the resumption of hostilities in 1911 was the TW-1C (Truck/Walker-1) 'Elephant'. Armed versions known as MTW-7 Phalanx (Medium Transport Walker) are employed by all Coalition countries, although their combat performance against Tripods is insufficient."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_4: "Walker History IV"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_4_UFOPEDIA: "Until the General Counteroffensive of 1913, the employment of purely offensive Walkers was limited to small units that added guns and howitzers on an improvised basis. Developed since late 1912, the LCW-10 'Legionnaire' helped slow down the Martian hordes on all fronts. Nicknamed 'Mechanized Chicken' for its peculiar chassis and leg arrangement, the 'Legionnaires' are fast and agile enough to flank light and medium Tripods."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_5: "Walker History V"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_5_UFOPEDIA: "The need to transport more troops to the front lines, as well as support them, led to the creation of the 'Testudo'. The original design featured a chassis close to the ground, but improvements to the leg servo motors made it a tall quadruped. Ironically named 'Hannibal's Elephant', we are pretty sure it can also cross the Alps."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_6: "Walker History VI"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_6_UFOPEDIA: "The high incidence of 'Legionnaires' in prolonged engagement situations against enemy mechanized units prompted the creation of the 'Centurion', a combat unit with more powerful weapons and reinforced leg armor. Most Coalition armored regiments are expected to equip this mech."

      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_7: "Walker History VII"
      STR_WALKER_HISTORY_7_UFOPEDIA: "This walker is the largest we have built to date. It combines incredible endurance, excellent firepower and some extra space to transport troops directly to the battlefield. Initially it was the armament upgrade of the 'Centurion', but the weight increased so much that it was necessary to redesign and expand the legs, adopting a quadruped design."


      STR_TANK_HISTORY_1: "Tank History I"
      STR_TANK_HISTORY_1_UFOPEDIA: "The story of the modern tank began with the utility tracked haulers made by the Holt Company. Often employed to transport artillery pieces in difficult terrains, its mechanical reliability and widespread use allowed a latge amount of engineers to experiment on the design. Primitive examples made early in the war had machine guns and armored plates welded over the tractor frame, with varying degrees of success. French Colonel Jean Baptiste Estienne was the main advocate of the invention and adoption of armored vehicles to support the infantry. Initially, he proposed the implementation of {ALT}'mobile personal shields'{ALT} to protect advancing soldiers, but those proved too cumbersome to use. Further research was conducted. "
      STR_TANK_HISTORY_2: "Tank History II"
      STR_TANK_HISTORY_2_UFOPEDIA: "Colonel Estienne greatly promoted the development of an advanced armored unit mounted on a Holt tractor chassis, with offensive capabilities. After sending several letters to General Joffre and leading different trials, his proposal for an armored vehicle force was approved. The most promising prototype was the Schneider CA, armed with a shortened light cannon and a support machine gun. While a large number of these tanks could engage light Tripods, the main purpose was to augment the offensive capabilities of the infantry at platoon level.  "

The use of armor plating became obsolete with the introduction of gunpowder weapons in the modern battlefields. However, the idea has regained interest in the Great War, as certain materials have been tested to resist the alien weapons. The current prototype armors are heavy and cumbersome, but the development is very encouraged by the troops. The high amount of casualties are often due the lack of proper protection. The introduction of steel helmets is very appreciated, however; most of the indirect casualties were made by shrapnel and low flying debris."

This greatly improved the diplomatic and military relationship between Brazil and Argentina. However, almost led to a war with Chile, who grew weary of the increase of power of the regional alliance. The armed conflict was avoided by the actions of the Argentinian ambassador Tomás B. Lobo, who managed to create a new diplomatic arrangement between the three nations in 1895, called the ABC Pact.
