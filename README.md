 This mod created by the Inventorum Development Team for OpenXcom is located on an alternate WW1 where the enemy is not human, but Martian. Fight back the Sons of Ares using weapons from the Great War!

The Great War of the Worlds - 1914

Set in an alternate timeline where the Martians of the H.G. Wells masterpiece invaded Earth in 1896.
Swept by bacteria, the invasion came to an end just a couple of weeks after it started.
Humanity united and rebuilt and prepared for the worst. 12 years later, the mankind's worst nightmares came true. In 1908 the Martians launched a second invasion, this time more deadly.
Since they crash landed in Tungunska, their progress has been almost unstoppable.
From the Siberian tundra to the African jungle and the American Midwest, half of the world belongs to the Sons of Ares
What remains of the humanity united under the banner of the Coalition of Nations and have gone on the offensive.
Your unit is one of elite, formed with the best that the armies of the world have, the International Expeditionary Force.
The year is 1914.
This is the War to End All Wars.
TOGETHER WE STAND

Known issues:

*This is an open beta: the Tier I & II human weapons, Martian and their guns, six Tripods, nine Martian Bases, and seven Martian Flying Machines are available.
*The Geoscape is almost done, but the unique missions are still WIP. Expect to still find vanilla enemies.
*The weapons are less unbalanced
*The Triffids, Mutant Crusher, Line Infantry and Ravager disabled temporaly
*The custom damage types are not in the Martian armors yet
*A few starting techs available.
*Some translation on Spanish and French are missing
*Could be hidden bugs and crashes. Don't forget to report them!

*Try the weapons as much as you can, we want to balance them and your feedback will be fundamental to do it. At the moment, we have not included all the features and we have maintained research, races and vanilla weapons. In theory it should serve along with any other mod. As soon as we launch the complete version, we will deactivate most of the vanilla stuff
